# GravityChallenge

GravityChallenge is a **game of skill** in which the player has to **guide a ball through a course** without letting it fall into holes.

A vertical board contains holes of different sizes, and **two cords** are attached to the top corners with a ring where the ropes cross. 

The player collects a ball in the ring at the bottom of the board and moves it around the board by **adjusting the length of the two cords**.

The goal of the game is to move the ring from the bottom **to the top** of the board without letting **the ball fall into the holes**.

Inspired by a game designed and created by Massimiliano Colangelo of pianetaverde.eu, seen at La Venaria Reale in Turin.
